<h2>NIGHT PRAYER (Thursday 8-9pm)</h2>
<p> We do this so we can further deepen our knowledge of the Word of God and strengthen our relationship with Him. And of course, as believers, we also need to stay passionate for the Lord. We must not grow cold in our faith so that we won't be deceived by the enemy. It's important that we also encourage and strengthen one another as brothers and sisters in Christ.</p>

<h2>Youth service every month Sept 28 
        4PM - 6PM</h2>     
<p>youth service is a gathering dedicated to young people, designed to bring them together in worship, prayer, and studying God’s Word. The goal is to inspire the youth to grow deeper in their faith, develop their talents and abilities, and build a closer relationship with Christ.
Typically, the youth service includes vibrant praise and worship, meaningful messages tailored for young people, and activities that foster unity and fellowship. It’s also a space where testimonies can be shared, questions about faith can be asked, and support can be found among fellow youth and church leaders. The aim is to equip and empower the youth to become Christ-followers who care for their community and actively participate in God’s work.</p>

<h2> Baptism</h2>     
<p> The baptismal service in our church is an annual special event held to signify the believers' commitment to their faith in Christ. It is a meaningful ceremony symbolizing new life and cleansing from sin through obedience to God's command.
This takes place in a designated location, such as a river, sea, or baptismal pool, where each candidate is baptized in water as a public declaration of their personal acceptance of Jesus as Lord and Savior. The event includes worship songs, sharing of testimonies, and a short message from church leaders emphasizing the importance of baptism.   
It is also an opportunity for the church to come together in celebration of each member's spiritual transformation and their journey of faith.</p>

It’s a time to honor God, strengthen our faith, and connect with one another. The service also provides encouragement and guidance for daily life, helping us to stay rooted in our relationship with Christ. It is a sacred moment to seek His presence and be empowered for the week ahead.</p>
